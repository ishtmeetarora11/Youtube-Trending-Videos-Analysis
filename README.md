# Youtube-Trending-Videos-Analysis
In this project, we will use Python with some packages like Pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn, scikit learn etc. to analyze a dataset that was fetched from Kaggle. The dataset contains data about the trending videos of a particular day. It contains data about more than 35,000 trending videos. We analyzed this data to get an accurate and deep understanding of the trending videos, to see what was common between these videos.
